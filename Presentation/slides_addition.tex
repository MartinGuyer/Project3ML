Things to put in slides besides what's in the report:
\begin{enumerate}
\item R package used: \texttt{e1071} library \texttt{naiveBayes} plus \texttt{predict} function; \texttt{ROCR} library \texttt{pred} and \texttt{performance} functions
\item ROC plot for each run of CV
\item False negative rate and APER for several choices of threshold
\item Comparison of results and running time if we use small training set and large validation set
\item Obstacles:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which classification method should we use?
\item Tried logistic regression: didn't work because iterative algorithm didn't converge
\item K-nearest neighbours: didn't work because \texttt{knn} doesn't take distance matrix as input, instead, it calculates a Euclidean distance matrix automatically
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
